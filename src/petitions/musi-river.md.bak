##### To Whomsoever Concerned,

As a proud resident of Telangana and someone who is deeply committed to protecting our environment and the future of our communities, I feel compelled to address the serious concerns surrounding the ongoing Musi Riverfront Development Project. While the Congress-led government has initiated some positive actions, it is evident that critical issues are being overlooked, with potentially harmful consequences for both the environment and vulnerable communities.
<br><br>
#### Disregard for the Natural Flow
The project is disrupting the natural flow of the Musi River, increasing the risk of flooding, particularly with rising water levels due to climate change. Recent reports have highlighted dangerous water levels during heavy rains, creating flood-like conditions. **What concrete steps are being taken to mitigate these risks?**
<br><br>
#### Displacement of Vulnerable Communities
Displaced families are being forced into 2BHK units with rents of ₹8,000-9,000 per month, an amount many cannot afford. This is worsening their financial burdens. **How will the government ensure that these families are provided with fair, affordable housing options that don’t push them further into poverty?**
<br><br>
#### Impact on 60+ Villages
More than 60 villages from Ananthagiri to Hyderabad depend on the Musi River for agriculture and daily livelihood. Altering the river’s natural course will devastate these communities, impacting their livelihoods and forcing potential displacement. **What is being done to safeguard their futures?**
<br><br>
Furthermore, cleaning the Musi River should be about restoring the ecosystem and creating a healthier environment, not about profit-driven motives. This should be a project that respects the river's natural flow and the communities around it. Done correctly, this could offer a healthier, cleaner environment for future generations while positioning Telangana as a leader in sustainability and quality of life.
<br><br>
It’s time for the government to step up with real action. I strongly urge you to provide a detailed plan that demonstrates how this project will balance environmental sustainability with the needs of the people and prevent further damage. Vague promises are no longer enough—transparent and accountable action is required now.
<br><br>

A Concerned Citizen
